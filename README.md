# odin-recipes

The project was to create a website that had an index file that could link to several recipes, each with ingredients and instructions.
This recipe website include two recipes, those being Lasagna and Chicken Teriyaki. 
Some skills I used were creating a boilerplate HTML file, knowing how to use ordered and unordered lists, as well as adding images to my HTML files.
